# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

A deep learning-based time series prediction project that uses an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to predict future stock prices. Implemented in Python using TensorFlow and historical data fetched from Yahoo Finance.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project demonstrates how to:
- Collect historical stock price data using `yfinance`
- Preprocess the data for time series forecasting
- Build an LSTM model to learn from past data
- Predict future stock closing prices
- Visualize both actual and predicted values

- **Language:** Python 3.10+
- **Libraries:**
  - `pandas`, `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `yfinance`, `pandas_datareader`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `tensorflow` (with Keras backend)
